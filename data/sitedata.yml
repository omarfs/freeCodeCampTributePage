    summary: "Pablo Honey was released on 22 February 1993. The album received a generally favourable reception from critics, but was criticised by many for its derivative sound and inclusion of underdeveloped songs, and is often held in a negative light in comparison to the band's subsequent studio albums. However, some retrospectives have also shown it in a more positive light as well."

    summary: The Bends marked the beginning of a shift in aesthetics and themes for the band, with greater use of keyboards, and more abrasive guitar tracks while balancing with subtler ones. The introspective grunge-influenced style of their debut studio album Pablo Honey (1993) evolved into more multi-layered rock with cryptic lyrics and larger ideas, as the band and singer Thom Yorke reacted against the rigors of their near-constant world tours.

    summary: With OK Computer Radiohead made a deliberate attempt to distance themselves from the guitar-oriented, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and wide range of influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.

    summary: Burnt out after promoting Radiohead's acclaimed 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Incorporating influences from genres such as krautrock, jazz, 20th-century classical music, electronic music of Warp artists, Radiohead replaced their guitars with synthesisers, drum machines, the ondes Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 finished tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album, Amnesiac, released the following year.
